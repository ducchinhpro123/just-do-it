Hi there! Join me on an adventure into the fascinating and vital world of data structures and algorithms.
The purpose of this site is to share and contribute. I will try my best to explain some of the concepts that you
may encounter in your courses such as Big O notation, Time complexity, Trees, Hash Maps, Binary search, and more.

I'm a self-taught data structures and algorithms (DSA), I learn it mostly from reading books, and in the process of learning, I realized
that if we understand more about DSA, we will be able to write a better program in our favorite programming languages. Our problem-solving
skills will develop. There are so many benefits we can gain from learning DSA. It's not only applied in writing a program but also in real life.
It's a problem-solving skill.
